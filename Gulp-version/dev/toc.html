<h2>Why Less Shell ?</h2>
<p>There are many LESS frameworks out there, Bootstrap being the pre-dominant one. But there are not many frameworks for structuring large-scale applications. The purpose of LESS-SHELL is to create a shell and structure for your application.</p>

<p>You are going to benefit if you are already using Angular because all of the components are written with Angular and tested so you don't have to worry about writing the tests for the directives</p>

<h2>What does it provide?</h2>
<p>LESS-SHELL provoides you with structure, and that is the main purpose of this framework. Its primary goal is not to make your apps pretty but well structured. Change is inevitable in large scale applications and having a system that faciliates that change is key and that is why LESS SHELL is here for.</p>

<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>The project is now under development and there is only one person working on this project. Feel free to fork the project and send pull requests and suggestions. Thins are a bit flexible at this stage of development because there is not much code written yet.</p>
